### DESCRIBTION  
##### SOHOdata.xlsx 
is the set of CMEs obtained from SOHO/LASCO CME catalog. 

##### omni_Example.txt 
is the solar wind data obtained from OMNI database. 

##### omni.fmt.txt 
is the format of OMNI data. 

##### semimanual_matching_RUN.m 
is the main file (Run this). 

##### cme_icme_V4.m 
is the matching function and it includes a prediction model based on G2001 model (Gopalswamy et al. 2001). 

##### findTrend.m 
is using the cell array "C" from the previous code to find the trends in solar wind data. 

##### command_window.txt
